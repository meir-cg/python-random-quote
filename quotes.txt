Responsive is better than fast
It's not fully shipped until it's fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
Hakuna Matata
There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.
You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.
Success is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it.
Have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time.
Never make someone a priority when all you are to them is an option.
